# Jack Dash

Jack Dash is a little helper library I have built for personal projects & got the idea from libraries such as Lodash! This is nothing fancy but a nice little toolbox for me to use now and again. Please feel free to use this library and if you want, add your own :D

If you do decide to add your own methods then please make sure you test your code otherwise your pull request will be declined. I am going to be adding Travis CI to the project just for a bit of fun and sense of security!

I hope you like it :D
